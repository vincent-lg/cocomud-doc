h1. What's new in recent builds

This page describes the new features added and changes made to each build.  You can browse through each build using headings.

h2. Build 44

* Add a SharpScript action to repeat the last command (#85):
  This action, called @#repeat@, can be used to repeat the last entered command or send a command multiple times.  It can easily be connected to a macro.
* When pressing a shortcut to a macro, go to the end of the window (#80).
* Fix several conflicts when opening the same world in different tabs (#90).

h2. Build 43

* Add a documentation file to [[Download|download and install CocoMUD]].
* Add shortcut keys to add, edit or remove in all dialog boxes (#87).

h2. Build 42

* Add the triggers with substitution (#79):
  Triggers can now handle substitution, that is replace one or more lines in the client.
* Update proper colors with the rich-text setting.
* Fix a bug with the cursor moving a bit randomly when several tabs were opened (#53).

h2. Build 41

* Add default characters (#77):
  In the character dialog, one can now specify that a character should be loaded by default.  When selecting a world in the connection list, the default character of this world (if any) is automatically selected.  This saves time if you often login to the same character of a world, and doesn't prevent login on others.
* When creating a new character with special characters (like accents), CocoMUD doesn't crash at startup (#78).
* When CocoMUD loses connection, it will attempt to reconnect and enter the username / password if a character is set (#67):
  This fix is not perfect, it remains difficult to handle connection errors.
* When no update is available, the message is correctly displayed (#75).

h2. Build 40

* Add a setting to disable rich text control (#82).
  You will find this setting in the menu bar, *File* -> *Preferences*, *Accessibility* tab.  Disabling the rich text control can be useful for accessibility, although it removes colors from the client.
* Creating a new world and closing the dialog does not lead to an error (#69).
* Fix a bug when closing all tabs in the client.

h2. Build 39

* Add a button to import a world right in the connection window (#60):
  It is now possible to import a world before connecting (which makes more sense in most cases).  Simply click on the *Import*  button in the connection window and select whether you want to import a world online or on disk.
* Display a dialog box to announce the world was correctly installed (#63).
* Installing a world with channels doesn't create "popup" windows (#81).
* Restarting CocoMUD after installing a new world isn't required anymore.

h2. Build 38

* Add notepads for each world and characters (#62):
  CocoMUD now keeps track of separate files, where you can store any information, like exploring landmarks, quest reminders and so on.  You have a specific notepad for each world, which can be opened through the menu bar -> *Game* -> *Notepad* -> *For this world...* menu.  Simply type in your text, press Escape when you want to close it and save it.  The same system holds true for character-specific notepads, which you can open in the menu bar, *Game* -> *Notepad* -> *For this character...* menu.  This second notepad will not be accessible through other characters of this world.
* Add a documentation for [[Macros|macros]].
* Add the mark triggers in the trigger dialog (#30).
* Allow triggers without action (most useful for mark triggers).
* Fix several visual errors in the interface.

h2. Build 37

* Add the ability to configure characters in worlds (#61):
  This feature allows to create several characters per world.  Characters can contain more specific configuration (like aliases, macros or triggers), but also login information.  A character will store the information in an encrypted file, to login more quickly.
  To create a character, choose a world from the list in the connection area, then press tab and select "any" (the default choice).  Press RETURN or click the *connect* button.  You have opened a random character associated with this world.  To now save it, go to the menu bar, *game* -> *Change this character's setting...*.  In this dialog, enter a name for the newly-created character, a username (or a list of commands to be sent before the password), the password itself and then a list of commands to be sent after the password (if any).  Click *OK* to save in an encrypted file.  The next time you connect, you should see this character in the available list (select the world, then press Tab to find this character).  CocoMUD will enter the commands you have provided, and will do so if you ask to be reconnected as well.
* Fix a bug when trying to create a new world (#66).
* Add the crash report dialog:
  This dialog appears when an error occurs during a given task.  It will provide you with additional information about the bug, and will explain you how to report this bug to the team of developers.

h2. Build 36

* Add the marked trigger (#30).
  Marked triggers can ask to move the cursor to a specific line.  For instance, if one receives a message, the cursor can be moved right on this message.  This can also help to explore, to move the cursor on the list of exits, for instance.
* Update the client's design and window.
* Add support for handling colors (#65).

h2. Build 35

* Add the feature to import a world, from a file or online (#60).
  There is now a new menu, "import", in the menu bar -> *file* menu.  In it are two options, one to import a world from a file, the other to import one online.  The second option tries to find the worlds already configured on the project's website.  One can download and install them directly.

h2. Build 34

* Add the system of channels (#50):
Channels can keep track of a list of events.  They are particularly useful to log communication channels on the MUD.  Through the trigger system, users can feed a channel.  Through a macro or alias, this channel can be displayed in a list, in a separate dialog box.
* In the preferences dialog, *accessibility* tab, users now can set whether the TTS is interrupted or not (#40).
* When changing the TTS options in the preferences, the options are taken into account immediately (#55).
* Fix some bugs in the SharpScript engine.

h2. Build 33

* Multiline aliases/macros/triggers do not bug anymore (#63).
* One can now enter SharpScript in macros (#59).
* Variables are now described in the [[Alias|alias]] documentation.
* The title of the window with several open tabs is now accurately updated (#51).

h2. Build 32

* Add a syntax to write variables in SharpScript:
  The syntax is @$variable@.  Variables have been added to aliases (#45) and triggers (#44).
* Fix a minor bug in command stacking.
* Add mute triggers, which will be useful to support audio prompts.

h2. Build 31

* Improve the debug logging system.
* Restructure the catalogs for translation (#41).

h2. Build 30

* Add a logging system to debug events.

h2. Build 29

* Attempt to fix a bug using the @#play@ function while several worlds are opened (#48).

h2. Build 28

* Add [[CommandStacking|command stacking]], to send multiple commands at once, using the semicolon or another character (#32).

h2. Build 27

* Open multiple worlds in tabs (#42):
  It is now possible to open several worlds in tabs, or even a world several times in tabs.  In the file menu are three new options, to create a new world, open a world in a different tab and close the current tab.  One can navigate between tabs using Ctrl + tab or Ctrl + Shift + tab as usual.
  The feature to change the window's title when unread messages are received (#20) now takes into account the selected tab only.
* New menus to disconnect and reconnect from a world (#43):
  A new menu item in the menu bar, named connection, has been added.  In it are options to disconnect from the current world, and reconnect to it.
* The client doesn't lag if connection to a distant server takes some time (#21).

h2. Build 26

* When outside of the window, if messages are received, the window title changes to let the user know notifications are waiting on the client (#20).

h2. Build 25

* Add the command history
  The command history remembers all commands you have entered.  You can use it by pressing CTRL + up or down to go up or down into your list of commands.  Alternatively, you can use command history in lock mode, by pressing Escape, then navigating in the history using the arrow keys.  You can leave lock mode by pressing Escape again.
* One can now paste several lines to send multiple commands (#27).

h2. Build 24

* Update the documentation of the basic features (#36).
* Remove the obsolete settings based on an input and output field (#35).
* When tabbing to tab-complete, the TTS speaks (and displays) the found result.

h2. Build 23

* Add the tab-completion (#34):
  When the client receives messages from the server, it stores all words by frequency.  When you begin typing a letter or more and then press tab, the client will try to finish the word you were typing.  If you're not satisfied with this choice, you can press tab again and the client will display another result.
